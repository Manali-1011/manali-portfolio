                <h3>&#9654; Tic Tac Toe Game</h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/Manali-1011/tic-tac-toe-cpp">View project on Github</a><br>
                <p>Developed a fully functional console-based Tic Tac Toe game in C++ that allows two players to compete by taking turns on a 3x3 grid. The project demonstrates solid understanding of core programming fundamentals including loops, functions, conditional logic, and input validation. Implemented game mechanics such as alternating turns, preventing overwriting of already filled cells, and checking for win conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.</p>
                <p>The application provides clear real-time feedback to players, displaying the game board after each move, announcing the winner, or declaring a draw when no more moves are possible. The code is structured in a clean, modular format to enhance readability and maintainability. This project showcases beginner-level game logic, problem-solving, and the ability to design an interactive CLI application without external libraries.</p>

                <h3>&#9654; Automated Attendance System</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented a smart RFID-based attendance system using Arduino to automate student attendance tracking. Each student was assigned a unique RFID tag, and upon placing the tag near the RFID reader, the system automatically identified the tag ID and marked the student as "Present" on the display screen in real time. This eliminated the need for manual roll calls, significantly reducing human error and saving classroom time.</p>

                <p>The system demonstrated seamless integration of hardware and software by combining Arduino microcontroller programming, RFID communication protocols, and LCD display interfacing. It strengthened understanding of embedded system development, serial communication, and sensor-based automation.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the project showcased practical application of real-world IoT concepts by providing a reliable, fast, and scalable attendance solution that can later be expanded with features such as data logging, wireless connectivity, or centralized database storage for analytics and record-keeping.

                <h3>&#9654; Smart Vehicle Access System</h3>
                <p>Each driver carried an RFID tag that represented their verified driving license. When the RFID tag was scanned by the reader, the system automatically checked its validity. If the tag matched a verified license ID stored in the system, the ignition was allowed and the vehicle could start. If an unregistered or invalid tag was detected, the display showed "Not Eligible" , preventing the car from starting.</p>

                <p>This project aimed to enhance driving safety and security by ensuring that only authorized and licensed individuals could operate the vehicle. It demonstrated a real-world application of RFID technology in access control and transportation safety.</p>

                <p>Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in interfacing the RFID module with a microcontroller, implementing authentication logic, and displaying system feedback on a screen. This strengthened my understanding of embedded systems, RFID-based security applications, automotive safety mechanisms, and practical IoT concepts.
