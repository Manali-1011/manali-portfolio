    <div class="aboutpara">
    <p>I am a third-year Computer Engineering student passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I enjoy building projects using C++ and exploring web development with HTML and CSS, and I am currently improving my skills in Git and GitHub version control.</p>

    <p>Alongside academics, I actively participate in college technical and cultural events as a volunteer in the ACES Committee, contributing to event planning, coordination, and execution. I am also an Internshala Student Partner, where I help fellow students learn about internships, online training, and career opportunities.</p>

    <p>I believe in learning by doing- whether it's building small projects, participating in workshops, or challenging myself through platforms like LeetCode. Outside tech, I am a sportsperson with a strong competitive spirit. I have represented school in competitive short-distance athletic events and competed at ZP level in basketball in junior college.</p>

    <p>I'm always open to opportunities that allow me to grow, gain experience, and apply my skills in real-world projects.</p>
